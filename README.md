Conference Room ManagerApp

This project, I had to make as home task for a company(I don't know if I can say the name). 
The task was to creat application managing conference room for small company. All requirements were contained in the mail,
it was very clear what to do. I liked that very much. It made it just a little bit easier.
I had to make this application, like I would do it for a client, so all commits, cointains information what I did.
I need to add that, this is just backend app. 
There were suggested technologies but not required. I had to decide by my own what to choose.
Technologies:
-Spring Boot
-Spring Framework
-Restful api
-JPA
-H2
-Insomnia(for checking my requests)
-Spring Security
Short description what this app can do:
-Creating Users and Rooms(Editing, Deleteing them too)
-Booking rooms for some period of time
-Getting list of booked rooms(All of them, by User, via Room)
Just simple manager. There are I can add more, but unfortunately, I was out of the time. Maybe next time!

Hope You like it :)
Stay tuned!
